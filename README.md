# Calculator

This repository contains a simple command line calculator implemented in Python.

## Usage

Run the script and pass a mathematical expression as an argument:

```bash
python calculator.py "2 + 3 * 4"
```

The calculator supports basic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-),
multiplication (*), division (/), exponentiation (**), and modulus (%). It also
handles parentheses and unary negation.

## Web Frontend

A small web server provides an HTML interface.
Start it with:

```bash
python server.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to use the calculator from
your web browser.
